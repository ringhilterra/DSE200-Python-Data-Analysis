## Scrapy

Scrapy is open source software for crawling the web, extracting and parsing content. The jupyter notebook in `ipynb/02_web_scraping.ipynb` will introduce you to scrapy.

### A detailed tutorial

Scrapy can be used in several different ways: as a library of classes to be used in your own code. As a command line interface that 
is used to interactively scrape a web site, or as a programmable crawling and scraping system which can extract content automatically over long periods of time.
