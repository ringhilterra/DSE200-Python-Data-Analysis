    """Demonstrates how to fill the docstrings with Method1

    The :func:`function1`'s docstring is composed as follows:

    - sections such as **parameters**, **types**, **return** and **return types**
      use the following sphinx syntax (*Info field lists*)::

          :param arg1: description
          :param arg2: description
          :type arg1: type description
          :type arg1: type description
          :return: return description
          :rtype: the return type description

    - Other sections such as **Example**, or non-standard section's name are
      written using the double commas syntax::

          :Example:
          :Your preferred section title:

      which appears as follow:

      :Example:

      :Your preferred section title:

    - Finally special sections such as **See Also**, **Warnings**, **Notes**
      use the sphinx syntax (*paragraph directives*)::

          .. seealso:: blabla
          .. warnings also:: blabla
          .. note:: blabla
          .. todo:: blabla

    .. note::
        There are many other Info fields but they may be redundant:
            * param, parameter, arg, argument, key, keyword: Description of a
              parameter.
            * type: Type of a parameter.
            * raises, raise, except, exception: That (and when) a specific
              exception is raised.
            * var, ivar, cvar: Description of a variable.
            * returns, return: Description of the return value.
            * rtype: Return type.

    .. note::
        There are many other directives such as versionadded, versionchanged,
        rubric, centered, ... See the sphinx documentation for more details.

    Here below is the results of the :func:`function1` docstring.

    Then, you can compare with the second method in :class:`MainClass2`

        switch the order):
          - parameters using ``:param <name>: <description>``
          - type of the parameters ``:type <name>: <description>``
          - returns using ``:returns: <description>``
          - examples (doctest)
          - seealso using ``.. seealso:: text``
          - notes using ``.. note:: text``
          - warning using ``.. warning:: text``
          - todo ``.. todo:: text``

        **Advantages**:
         - Uses sphinx markups, which will certainly be improved in future
           version
         - Nice HTML output with the See Also, Note, Warnings directives


        **Drawbacks**:
         - Just looking at the docstring, the parameter, type and  return
